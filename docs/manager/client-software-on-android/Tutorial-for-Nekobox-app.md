# Tutorial for Nekobox app
This application is one of the applications that can be used for Android, which works relatively well for old devices.

## Download the application

To download, you can refer to the GitHub of the project [here](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid).

## Initial settings

* Activate the `use system dns as direct dns option` through `Settings`.
* Also set `subscription min tls version` to `1.3`.

> Note: if you are using old devices, set `tls` to `1.2`.

## Tutorial on making Proxy Chain
In this method, the traffic is transferred from one proxy to another, and it allows you to remain hidden or anonymous much longer than the previous methods, and also to be more secure.

* Configure the `add` or `import` option through `manual settings`.

* Select `Proxy chain`.

* Click `Add profile` and select and enter, for example, a reality config.

* For the second proxy, for example, we use Cloudflare worker and save the profile.

* Now go [here](https://ip.gs/) to check if it was done correctly. If Cloudflare's IP is seen, it means the job is done correctly.

> Note: When using this method, the ping test may encounter an error, which is a bug that needs to be fixed. But the filter connection is established and there is no problem.

> You can also use `http` and `socks5` in this method.

> You can also use more than 2 proxies to connect at the same time.
